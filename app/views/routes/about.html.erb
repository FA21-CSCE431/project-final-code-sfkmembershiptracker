<h2 class="text-2xl mb-3">Our Mission</h2>
<p class="mb-5">
    We hope to create possibilities for children (ages ~4-12) from the Bryan/College Station 
    area to obtain involvement in youth organized sports and by promoting the importance of athletic 
    activities in the lives of young people. In doing this, we hope to display how a student organization 
    can positively impact a community while creating an enthusiastic social environment.
